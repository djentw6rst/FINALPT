                    <p>Hello! I’m John Christian Leoncio, a third-year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student at City of Malabon University. With a deep passion for web development, I specialize in the front-end side of things.

                    <p>Aside from coding, I am a musically inclined individual. I’m an electric guitarist and a big fan of instrumental, math rock, metal, pop punk, and punk rock genres. My inspirations include bands like Polyphia, My Chemical Romance, CHON, Pierce the Veil, Sleeping with Sirens, and Dream Theater. Music fuels my creativity and pushes me to bring harmony and rhythm to everything I create, including code.</p>

                    <p> One of the proudest moments of my journey so far was winning a prestigious hackathon in 2023. 
                        Alongside a team of talented individuals, we collaborated, innovated, and overcame challenges to develop a solution that stood out among many remarkable projects. 
                        This experience not only tested our technical skills but also strengthened my problem-solving, teamwork, and adaptability under pressure. 
                        It was a reminder of what can be achieved with dedication and creativity.</p>
